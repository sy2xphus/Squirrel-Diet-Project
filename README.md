# Squirrel-Diet-Project
This project based on results of a mock study where 100 red squirrels were given one of three different diets after weaning, and their full grown adult weights were recorded. There is a figure displays results of the study.
The project shows the possibilities of seaborn and matplotlib Python libraries.
The main goal was to recreate the plot as closely as possible using these libraries.
